**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Screenshots are often helpful here.

Do *NOT* just paste a link to other issues on GitHub.

**To Reproduce**

Either:

1. Reproduce your issue in the [Chroma Playground](https://swapoff.org/chroma/playground/), then click the _copy_ icon to copy a shareable link for your issue. Consider using `[markdown links](URL)` to minimise the visual noise of the links.
2. Provide input text and a command-line invocation of `chroma` that reproduces your problem. eg. For Hugo this might be something like `chroma -s monokailight --html --html-lines --html-lines-table --html-inline-styles <source>`

Do *NOT* provide configuration for another tool (eg. Hugo). My time is limited and if you want me to fix your issue, help me help you.
